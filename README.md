Coursera Course Recommendation System

•	Developed a course recommendation system that recommended multiple courses from coursera using user's Linkedin profile.
•	Compute Engine was used to analyse the user’s profile and finalize experience level for each of his/her skill.
•	Rule Engine was used to apply rules so that those courses are searched which are on the higher level than each of the user’s skill.
•	Popularity of each course was determined by crawling all the social media websites, for example, Facebook, Twitter, as to how many times a course has been mentioned.
